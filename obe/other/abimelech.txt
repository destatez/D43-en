====== Abimelech ======

===== Facts: =====

Abimelech was a Philistine king over the region of Gerar during the time when Abraham and Isaac were licing in the land of Canaan.

  * Abraham deceived King Abimelech by telling him that Sarah was his sister rather than his wife.
  * Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement regarding ownership of wells at Beersheba.
  * Many years later, Isaac also deceived Abimelech and the other men of Gerar by saying that Rebekah was his sister, not his wife.
  * King Abimelech rebuked Abraham and then Isaac for lying to him.
  * Another man by the name of Abimelech was a son of Gideon and a brother of Jotham. Some translations may use a slightly different spelling of his name to make it clear that he is a different person from King Abimelech.
