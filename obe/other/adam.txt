====== Adam ======

===== Facts: =====

Adam was the first person whom God created. He and his wife Eve were made in the image of God. 

  * God formed Adam from dirt and breathed life into him.
  * Adam's name sounds similar to the Hebrew word for "red dirt" or "ground."
  * The name "Adam" is the same as the Old Testament word for "mankind" or "human being."
  * All people are descendants of Adam and Eve.
  * Adam and Eve disobeyed God. This separated them from God and caused sin and death to come into the world.
