====== armor ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "armor" refers to the equipment a soldier uses to fight in a battle and protect himself from enemy attacks. It is also used in a figurative way to refer to spiritual armor.

  * Parts of a soldier's armor include a helmet, a shield, a breastplate, leg coverings, and a sword.
  * Using the term figuratively, the apostle Paul compares physical armor to spiritual armor that God gives the believer to help him fight spiritual battles.
  * The spiritual armor God gives his people to fight against sin and Satan includes truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation, and the Holy Spirit.
  * This could be translated with a term that means, "soldier gear" or "protective battle clothing" or "protective covering" or "weapons."
