====== Babylon, Babylonian ======

===== Facts: =====

The city of Babylon was the capital of the ancient region of Babylonia, which was also part of the Babylonian Empire.

  * Babylon was located along the Euphrates River, in the same region where the Tower of Babel had been built hundreds of years before.
  * Sometimes the word "Babylon" refers to the entire Babylonian Empire. For example, the "king of Babylon" ruled the entire empire, not just the city.
  * The Babylonians were a powerful people group who attacked the kingdom of Judah and kept the people in exile in Babylonia for 70 years.
  * Part of this region was called "Chaldea" and the people living there were the "Chaldeans." As a result, the term "Chaldea" was often used to refer to Babylonia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * In the New Testament, the term "Babylon" is sometimes used as a metaphor to refer to places, people, and thinking patterns that are associated with idol-worship and other sinful behaviors.
  * The phrase "Babylon the Great" or "great city of Babylon" refers metaphorically to a city or nation that was large, wealthy, and sinful, just as the ancient city of Babylon was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
