====== Gibeon, Gibeonite ======


===== Facts: =====

Gibeon was a city that was located about 13 kilometers northwest of Jerusalem. The people living in Gibeon were the Gibeonites.

  * When the Gibeonites heard about how the Israelites had destroyed the cities of Jericho and Ai, they were afraid.
  * So the Gibeonites came to the leaders of Israel at Gilgal and pretended to be people from a far-away country. 
  * The Israelite leaders were deceived and made an agreement with the Gibeonites that they would protect them and not destroy them.
