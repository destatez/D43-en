====== Gideon ======

===== Facts: =====

Gideon was an Israelite man who God raised up to deliver the Israelites from their enemies.

  * During the time when Gideon lived, a people group called the Midianites kept attacking the Israelites and destroying their crops.
  * Even though Gideon was afraid, God used him to lead the Israelites to fight against the Midianites and defeat them.
  * Gideon also obeyed God by taking down altars to the false gods Baal and Asherah.
  * He not only led the people in defeating their enemies but also encouraged them to obey and worship Yahweh, the one true God.
