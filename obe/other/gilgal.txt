  * Gilgal was the city that Elijah and Elisha were leaving as they crossed the Jordan when Elijah was taken up to heaven.
  * There were also several other places called "Gilgal" in the Old Testament.
  * The word "gilgal" means "circle of stones," perhaps referring to a place where a circular altar was built.
