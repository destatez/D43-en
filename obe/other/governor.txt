====== governor, govern, proconsul ======

===== Definition: =====

A governor is a person who rules over a state, region, or territory. The word "govern" means to guide, lead, or manage people.

  * In Bible times, governors were appointed by a king or emperor and were under his authority.
  * They were under the authority of that king or emperor.
  * Sometimes in the Bible the title "proconsul" is used for a person who governs. 

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The word "governor" can also be translated as "ruler" or "overseer" or "regional leader" or "one who rules over a small territory."
  * Depending on the context, the term "govern" could be translated as, "rule over" or "lead" or "manage" or supervise."
  * Since a governor was under the authority of a king or emperor and had less power and importance than those rulers, this term should be translated differently than those terms.
