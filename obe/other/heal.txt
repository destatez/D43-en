====== heal, cure ======


===== Definition: =====


The terms "heal" and "cure" both mean to cause a sick, wounded, or disabled person to be healthy again.

    * A person who is "healed" or "cured" has been "made well" or "made healthy."
    * Healing can happen naturally since God gave our bodies the ability to recover from many kinds of wounds and diseases. Thsi kind of healing usually happens slowly.
    * However, certain conditions such as being blind or paralyzed, and certain serious diseases such as leprosy do not heal on their own. When people are healed of these things, it is a miracle that usually happens suddenly.
    * For example, Jesus healed many people who were blind or lame or diseased and they became well right away.
    * The apostles also healed people miraculously, such as when Peter caused a crippled man to immediately be able to walk.
