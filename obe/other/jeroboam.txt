====== Jeroboam ======

===== Facts: =====

Jeroboam son of Nebat was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel around 900-910 BC. Another Jeroboam, son of King Jehoash, ruled over Israel about 120 years later.

  * Yahweh gave Jeroboam son of Nebat a prophecy that he would become king after Solomon and that he would rule ten tribes of Israel.
  * When Solomon died, the ten northern tribes of Israel rebelled against Solomon's son Rehoboam and instead made Jeroboam their king, leaving Rehoboam as king of only the southern two tribes, Judah and Benjamin.
  * Jeroboam became a wicked king who led the people away from worshiping Yahweh and instead set up idols for them to worship. All the other kings of Israel followed Jeroboam's example and were evil like he was.
  * Almost 120 years later, another King Jeroboam began ruling the northern kingdom of Israel. This Jeroboam was the son of King Jehoash and was wicked like all the previous kings of Israel had been.
  * In spite of this, God had mercy on Israel and helped this King Jeroboam to gain land and establish boundaries for their territory.
