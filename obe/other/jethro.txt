====== Jethro, Reuel ======

===== Facts: =====

The names "Jethro" and "Reuel" both refer to the father of Moses' wife, Zipporah. There were also two other men named "Reuel" in the Old Testament.

  * When Moses was a shepherd in the land of Midian, he married the daughter of a Midianite man named Reuel.
  * Later on Reuel is referred to as "Jethro, the priest of Midian."  It could be that "Reuel" was his clan name.

  * Some time later, after God had rescued the Israelites from Egypt, Jethro came out to the Israelites in the wilderness and gave Moses good advice about judging the affairs of the people.
  * He believed in God when he heard about all the miracles God had done for the Israelites in Egypt.
