====== Jew, Jewish, Jews ======

===== Facts: =====

Jews are people who are descendants of Abraham's grandson, Jacob. The word "Jew" comes from the word "Judah."

  * People began to call the Israelites "Jews" after they returned to Judah from their exile in Babylon.
  * Jesus the Messiah was Jewish. However, the Jewish religious leaders rejected Jesus and demanded that he be killed.
  * Often the phrase "the Jews" refers to the leaders of the Jews, not all the Jewish people. In those contexts, some translations add "leaders of" to make this clear.
