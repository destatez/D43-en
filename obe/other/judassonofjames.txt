====== Judas the son of James ======

===== Facts: =====

Judas, son of James, was one of Jesus' twelve apostles. Note that this was not the same man as Judas Iscariot.

  * Often in the Bible, men with the same name are distinguished by mentioning whose son they were. Here, Judas is identified as the "son of James."
  * Another man named Judas was Jesus' brother. He was also known as "Jude."
  * The New Testament book called "Jude" was probably written by Jesus' brother Judas, since he identifies himself as the "brother of James." James was another brother of Jesus.
  * It is also possible that the book of Jude was written by Jesus' disciple, Judas, the son of James.
