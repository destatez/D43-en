====== Melchizedek ======
â€‹
===== Facts: =====

During the time when Abram lived, Melchizedek was the king of the city of Salem (later, "Jerusalem")

  * Melchizedek's name means, "king of righteousness" and his title "king of Salem" means "king of peace."
  * He was also called a "priest of God Most High."
  * Melchizedek is first mentioned in the Bible when he served Abram bread and wine after Abram rescued his nephew Lot from powerful kings. Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of the plunder from his victory.
  * In the New Testament, Melchizedek is described as someone who had no father or mother. He was called a priest and king who will reign forever. 
  * The New Testament also says that Jesus is a priest according to the priestly "order of Melchizedek." Jesus was not descended from Levi as the Israelite priests were. His priesthood is directly from God, as Melchizedek's was.
  * Based on these descriptions of him in the Bible, Melchizedek was a human priest who was also chosen by God to represent or point forward to Jesus, the eternal king of peace and righteousness and our great high priest.
