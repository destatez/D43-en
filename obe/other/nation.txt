====== nation ======

===== Definition: =====

A nation is a large group of people ruled by some form of government. The people of a nation often have the same ancestors and share a common ethnicity.

  * The word translated as "nation" is also used to refer to "Gentiles" or "nonJews." The context usually makes it clear what is being referred to.
  * The term "nation" usually includes the idea of a well-defined culture and territorial boundaries.
  * In the Bible, a "nation" can be a country (like Egypt or Ethiopia), but usually it is more general and refers to a people group, especially when used in the plural. It is important to check the context.
  * Nations in the Bible included the Israelites, the Philistines, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Canaanites, the Romans, and the Greeks, among many others.
  * Sometimes the word "nation" is used figuratively to refer to the ancestor of a certain people group, as when Rebekah was told by God that her unborn sons were "nations" that would fight against each other. This could be translated as "the founders of two nations" or the "ancestors of two people groups."
