====== oil ======

===== Definition: =====

Oil is a thick, clear liquid that is taken from certain plants or fruits. In Bible times, oil usually came from olives.

  * Olive oil was used for cooking, anointing, sacrifice, lamps, and medicine.
  * In ancient times, olive oil was highly prized and the possession of oil was considered a measurement of wealth.
  * Make sure the translation of this term refers to the kind of oil that can be used in cooking, not motor oil. Some languages have different words for these different kinds of oil.
