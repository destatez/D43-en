  * Often punishment is intended to motivate a person to stop sinning.
  * God punished the Israelites when they disobeyed him, especially when they worshiped false gods. Because of their sin, God allowed their enemies to attack and capture them.
  * God is righteous and just, so he has to punish sin. Every human being has sinned against God and deserves punishment.
  * Jesus was punished for all the evil things that every person has ever done. He received each person's punishment on himself even though he did nothing wrong and did not deserve that punishment.
