===== Facts: =====

The term "purple" is the name of a color that is a mixture of blue and red.

  * In ancient times, purple was a rare and highly valuable color of dye that was used to dye the clothing of kings and other high officials.
  * Because it was costly and time-consuming to produce this dye, purple clothing was considered a sign of wealth, distinction, and royalty.
  * Purple was also one of the colors used for the curtains in the tabernacle and temple, and for the ephod worn by the priests.
  * Purple dye was extracted from a kind of sea snail by either crushing or boiling the snails or by causing them to release the dye while still alive. This was an expensive process.
