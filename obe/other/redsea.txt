====== Sea of Reeds ======


===== Facts: =====

The "Sea of Reeds" was the name of a body of water located between Egypt and Arabia. It is now called the "Red Sea."
 
  * The Red Sea is long and narrow. It is larger than a lake or river, but much smaller than an ocean.
  * The Israelites had to cross the Red Sea when they were fleeing from Egypt. God did a miracle and caused the waters of the sea to divide so that the people could walk across on dry land.
  * The land of Canaan was north of this sea.
  * This could also be translated as, "Reed Sea."
