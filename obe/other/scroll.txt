====== scroll ======

===== Definition: =====

In ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long, rolled-up sheet of papyrus or leather.

  * After writing on a scroll or reading it, people rolled it up using rods on the ends.
  * Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture.
  * Sometimes scrolls that were delivered by a messenger were sealed with wax. This would prevent anyone else from opening the scroll and writing on it.
  * Scrolls containing the Hebrew Scriptures were read aloud in the synagogues.
