====== shield ======

===== Definition: =====

A shield is an object held by a soldier in battle to protect himself from being injured by the enemy's weapons. "To shield" someone means to protect that person from harm.

  * Shields were often circular or oval in shape and were made of materials such as leather, wood, or metal that were sturdy and thick enough to keep a sword or arrow from piercing them.
  * Using this term as a metaphor, the Bible refers to God as a protective shield for his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * Paul also talks about the "shield of faith," which is a figurative way of saying that believing in Jesus, and living out that faith in obedience to God, will protect believers from spiritual attacks from Satan.
