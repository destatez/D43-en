====== thief, thieves, robber ======

===== Facts: =====

A "thief" or "robber" is a person who steals money or property from other people. The plural form of "thief" is "thieves."

  * Thieves often use an element of surprise, lurking and watching for opportune moments to take things. Often they use the cover of darkness to hide what they are doing.
  * The term "robber" sometimes also has the meaning of a person who does harm to others. The men who were crucified with Jesus are sometimes called "robbers" or "criminals."
  * In a figurative sense, the New Testament describes Satan as a thief who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. This means that Satan's plan is to try to get God's people to stop obeying him, stealing from them the good things God has planned for them to experience.
  * Just as a thief comes at a time when people are not expecting it, so Jesus will return at a time when people do not expect it. Since he will return suddenly and unexpectedly, Jesus told his followers that they should always be ready for him to come back.
