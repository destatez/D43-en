===== Facts: =====

In the Bible the term "time" is often used symbolically to refer to a specific season or period of time when certain events take place. It has a meaning similar to "age" or "epoch" or "season."

  * This is a different meaning from measurements of time such as minutes, hours, days or months.
  * Both Daniel and Revelation speak of a "time" of great trouble or tribulation that will come upon the earth.
  * In the phrase "time, times, and half a time" the term "time" means "year." This phrase refers to a three and a half year period of time during the great tribulation at the end of this present age.
  * Phrases such as "second time" or "many times" refer to the number of occurrences that something happened.
  * To be "on time" means to arrive when expected, and not late.
  * Depending on the context, the term "time" could be translated as, "season" or "time period" or "moment."
  * The phrase "times and seasons" is a figurative expression which states the same idea twice. This could also be translated as "certain events happening in certain time periods." [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
