===== Definition: =====

A tribe is a group of people who are usually descended from a common ancestor. 

  * People from the same tribe usually share a common language and culture.
  * In the Old Testament, God divided the people of Israel into twelve tribes. Each tribe was descended from a son or grandson of Jacob.
  * A tribe is smaller than a nation, but larger than a clan.
