====== Vashti ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Old Testament book of Esther, Vashti was the wife of Ahasuerus, king of Persia.

  * Vashti was rejected as queen when she refused to obey King Ahasuerus' order to come to his dinner party and show off her beauty to his drunken guests.
  * As a result, a search went out for a new queen and eventually Esther was chosen to be the king's new wife.
