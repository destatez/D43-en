====== voice ======

===== Definition: =====

A person uses his voice to speak, and so the term "voice" is often used figuratively to refer to speaking or communicating something.

  * God is said to use his voice, even though he doesn't have a voice in the same way a human being does.
  * A voice can be used to refer to the whole person, as in the statement "A voice is heard in the desert saying, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.'" This could be translated as, "A person is heard calling out in the desertâ€¦."
  * To "hear the voice of someone" could also be translated as "hear someone speaking."
  * Sometimes the word "voice" may be used for objects that cannot literally speak, such as when David wrote that the amazing things that God created proclaim his works, that their "voice" declares how great he is. This could be translated as "their splendor shows clearly how great God is."
